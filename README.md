Trying to get my hands dirty by doing some basic CS programs with Go. 

The code inspires itself heavily by following [Todd Mcleods course](https://www.udemy.com/learn-how-to-code) at udemy. He's a pretty cool instructor, highly recommended. 

So, lets begin. 

I'm starting with some basics like fmt package, TYPES, DECLARATIONS.

	+ hello.go
	+ gotypes.go
	+ controlflow.go

First I will be doing some builtin data structures in golang including: 
(Sidebar: refer https://research.swtch.com/godata for good insights into builtin golang data-structures)

	+ array -- arrays.go
	+ slices -- slice.go
	+ maps -- map.go
	+ struct -- struct.go

I will look into

	+ funtions   -- functions.go
	+ methods    -- methods.go
	+ interfaces -- interfaces.go
	+ pointers   -- pointers.go

Now we'll take a step back and see usages of the golang standard library including: 

	+ JSON Marshalling and Unmarshalling -- json_marshal_in_golang.go
	+ Writer Interface.-- writer_interface.go
	+ sort Package - sorting_package.go
	+ bcrypt - brcypt_in_go.go

Having a self-proclaimed proficiency in distributed systems, I will take a look at:

	+ Concurrency -- concurrency.go
	+ Channels -- channels.go, fan_in_channel.go, fan_out_channel.go 

Hopefully this is when things will start to get exciting and I can actually see the power of golang firsthand. 
 
Now that we are familiar with a lot of workings of golang. I will head off to an altogether new direction. However, to the keen learner, I recommend going over topics like error handling, documentation and testing in golang. I, however, would not be covering them in this repository. 

So, with the still elusive technical interviews in mind, I will will work on Computer Science fundamentals for data structures and algorithms:

	+ sorting algos - quicksort.go, 
	+ linked lists - Singly / Doubly Linked 
	+ FIFO Queue
	+ LIFO Stack 
	+ Binary Trees
	+ Binary Heaps / Priority Queues
	+ Hash Map/Sets and their types 
	+ BFS / DFS
	+ String Manipulations
	+ Dynamic Programming 

Mixing in some solutions to common LeetCode problems. 

	+ 
	+
	
Eventually and hopefully, I will also be designing and making some web services written in golang.(Update: Considering the significant size this repo has taken, I will use a separate repo for this purpose, but the foundations for that would be laid here)

Feel free to use this code to learn if you are a student, complying with the rules and regulations of your school and class. 

If you are a professional who is copying my code, dont know why you would do that but I wish you all the best!
