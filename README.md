Trying to get my hand dirty by doing some basic CS programs with Go. Lets see how it goes. 

I'm starting with some basics like fmt package, TYPES, DECLARATIONS. 

I will move onto doing some basic data structures implemented in golang including: 
	array
	linked lists - Singly / Doubly Linked 
	FIFO Queue
	LIFO Stack 
	Binary Trees
	Binary Heaps / Priority Queues
	Hash Map/Sets and their types 

Eventually I will also move to desigining and making some web services written in golang. 

Feel free to use this code to learn if you are a student, complying with the rules and regulations of your school and class. 

If you are a professional who is copying my code, dont know why you would do that but I wish you all the best!

noteToSelf: stick to all lowercase for go instead of camelCase
