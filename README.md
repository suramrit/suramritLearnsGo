Trying to get my hands dirty by doing some basic CS programs with Go. 

The code inspires itself heavily by following [Todd Mcleods course](https://www.udemy.com/learn-how-to-code) at udemy. He's a pretty cool instructor, highly recommended. 

So, lets begin. 

I'm starting with some basics like fmt package, TYPES, DECLARATIONS.

	+ hello.go
	+ gotypes.go
	+ controlflow.go

Then move onto doing some builtin data structures in golang including: 
(Sidebar: refer https://research.swtch.com/godata for good insights into builtin golang data-structures)

	+ array -- arrays.go
	+ slices -- slice.go
	+ maps -- map.go 

and move on to user defined data structures like

	+ linked lists - Singly / Doubly Linked 
	+ FIFO Queue
	+ LIFO Stack 
	+ Binary Trees
	+ Binary Heaps / Priority Queues
	+ Hash Map/Sets and their types 

Eventually and hopefully, I will also be designing and making some web services written in golang. 

Feel free to use this code to learn if you are a student, complying with the rules and regulations of your school and class. 

If you are a professional who is copying my code, dont know why you would do that but I wish you all the best!

noteToSelf: stick to all lowercase for go instead of camelCase
