Trying to get my hands dirty by doing some basic CS programs with Go. 

The code inspires itself heavily by following [Todd Mcleods course](https://www.udemy.com/learn-how-to-code) at udemy. He's a pretty cool instructor, highly recommended. 

So, lets begin. 

I'm starting with some basics like fmt package, TYPES, DECLARATIONS.

	+ hello.go
	+ gotypes.go
	+ controlflow.go

First I will be doing some builtin data structures in golang including: 
(Sidebar: refer https://research.swtch.com/godata for good insights into builtin golang data-structures)

	+ array -- arrays.go
	+ slices -- slice.go
	+ maps -- map.go
	+ struct -- struct.go

I will look into

	+ funtions   -- functions.go
	+ methods    -- methods.go
	+ interfaces
	+ pointers

Having a self-proclaimed proficiency in distributed systems, I will take a look at:

	+ Concurrency 
	+ Channels
Hopefully this is when things will start to get exciting and I can actually see the power of golang firsthand

With the still elusive technical interviews in mind, I will will work on Computer Science fundamentals for data structures and algorithms:

	+ sorting algos - quicksort.go, 
	+ linked lists - Singly / Doubly Linked 
	+ FIFO Queue
	+ LIFO Stack 
	+ Binary Trees
	+ Binary Heaps / Priority Queues
	+ Hash Map/Sets and their types 
	+ BFS / DFS
	+ String Manipulations
	+ Dynamic Programming 

Mixing in some solutions to some LeetCode problems. 

Eventually and hopefully, I will also be designing and making some web services written in golang. 

Feel free to use this code to learn if you are a student, complying with the rules and regulations of your school and class. 

If you are a professional who is copying my code, dont know why you would do that but I wish you all the best!

noteToSelf: stick to all lowercase for go instead of camelCase
