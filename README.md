# suramritLearnsGo

Trying to get my hand dirty by doing some basic CS programs with Go. Lets see how it goes. 

Feel free to use this code if you are a student, if you are a professional whos copying my code, I wish you all the best! 

noteToSelf: stick to all lowercase for go instead of camelCase
